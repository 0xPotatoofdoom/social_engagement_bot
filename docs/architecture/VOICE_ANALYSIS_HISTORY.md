## üìù Notes & Observations

### **Initial Observations - 2025-06-17**

**Surprises**:
- Technical expertise completely absent despite DeFi background
- Strong enthusiasm-engagement correlation discovered
- Optimal post length much shorter than expected
- Conversational tone as strongest differentiating characteristic

**Hypotheses for Testing**:
1. Adding technical content while maintaining conversational tone will increase authority without losing approachability
2. Intentionally increasing enthusiasm will directly improve engagement rates
3. Educational content (higher helpfulness) will build long-term audience quality
4. Question usage can be optimized as primary engagement tactic

**Areas for Deep Dive**:
- Why technical expertise is so low in current posts
- How to balance technical accuracy with conversational accessibility
- Optimal enthusiasm level before it becomes inauthentic
- Content themes beyond DEX/AMM that could perform well
